Hi I'm @agustinnb programming enthusiast. I will be uploading to my repositories different kinds of programs I have done beneath the past few years.

I have done all kinds of freelance programs, some in VB .net, some in C# .net, a few in R but most of them are written in PHP, javascript, css, html or Java (Android APKs)

Most of the programs are outdated, with poor documentation and need a bit of knowledge to make them work, I just don't have time to do it but feel free to clone or fork the repositories if you see something you like.

Hope you the best! :)
